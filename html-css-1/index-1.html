        <h2>About HTML5</h2>
        <img src="pngwing.com.png" id="html">
        <p>
          HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
          on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of
          HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
          current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is
          maintained HTMl by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
          Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application
          Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
          <br/> <br/>
          HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,
          with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
          Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
          multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily
          readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
          devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity;
          and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is
          intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHŤML 1 and DOM Level 2
          HTML.

            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
HTML and JavaScript.

CSS
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formating by specifying the relevant CSS in a
separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and
content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braile-based tactile devices.
CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the
specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading
priority scheme is predictable.
<br/><br/>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is
registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The ₩3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In
addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL
